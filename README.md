## User Story
As a user I'd like the ability to create list for any situation that comes to mind, such as shopping lists, wish-lists, travel destinations, etc. These lists would include a title, the description and a date. I would like to post these lists online so that I can share them with my friends and family, and anyone else who has an interest in posting lists. 

## Description
To build a CMS-style website where users can publish their lists. The application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure using Handlebars.JS, Sequelize and express-session. 

## Technologies Used 
* Utilized express-handlebars for the views and template language. 
* Utilized MySQL to connect to the database using Sequelize for the models. 
* Utilized Express.JS for API routes for the controllers.    
* Utilized Heroku to deploy the app on a live URL.
